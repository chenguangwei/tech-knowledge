Make your own AI QR Code by combining the QR code and art together with Stable Diffusion's ControlNet on ThinkDiffusion

### Step 1. Create Normal QR Code

- Firstly, we need to create a QR code. You can create one here for free at [https://keremerkan.net/qr-code-and-2d-code-generator/](https://keremerkan.net/qr-code-and-2d-code-generator/?ref=learn.thinkdiffusion.com)

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/Generate_QR_Code.png)

- Enter your url and it helps to use URL shortening. Set the error correction level to high as we are going to be blending the image with our own image.
- We can then generate a QR code and save it to your local pc.

### Step 2: Create Art for Combining with the QR Code

We can now either find an image we like or generate some from the txt2Img tab within Stable Diffusion. I am going to generate one within the **txt2Img tab**.

If you don't have Stable Diffusion installed locally, you can head over to [ThinkDiffusion](https://www.thinkdiffusion.com/?ref=learn.thinkdiffusion.com) to follow along. Simply select A1111 and launch a machine to get started.  

(The screenshots below are from Automatic1111 or A1111 for short, it's the de facto UI for Stable Diffusion)

Alrighty, let's do it!

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/txt-img-tab2.jpg)

- **(1)** The model is **revAnimated_v122**
- **(2)** Sampling method is **DPM++ 2S a Karras**
- **(3)** Sampling steps **is 20**
- **(4)** Resolution **768 x 768**
- **(5)** CFG scale **11**

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/QR-codes-combine.jpg)

- For the positive prompts, because we are using ControlNet_OpenPose_Full, it is best to include 'full body' in the positive prompts as we are mimicking the stance of our image. You can even change the resolution to width 512 and height 768 to make it a portrait, so that it interferes less with our QR code

**Positive Prompts:**  
*futobot, cyborg, ((masterpiece),(best quality),(ultra-detailed), (full body:1.2), 1 female, solo, hood up, upper body, mask, 1 girl, female focus, black gloves, cloak, long sleeves*

**Negative Prompts:**  
*paintings, sketches, (worst quality:2), (low quality:2), (normal quality:2), lowres, normal quality, ((monochrome)), ((grayscale)), skin spots, acnes, skin blemishes, age spot, glans, nsfw, nipples, (((necklace))), (worst quality, low quality:1.2), watermark, username, signature, text, multiple breasts, lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry, bad feet, single color, ((((ugly)))), (((duplicate))), ((morbid)), ((mutilated)), (((tranny))), (((trans))), (((trannsexual))), (hermaphrodite), extra fingers, mutated hands, ((poorly drawn hands)), ((poorly drawn face)), (((mutation))), (((deformed))), ((ugly)), blurry, ((bad anatomy)), (((bad proportions))), ((extra limbs)), (((disfigured))), (bad anatomy), gross proportions, (malformed limbs), ((missing arms)), (missing legs), (((extra arms))), (((extra legs))), mutated hands,(fused fingers), (too many fingers), (((long neck))), (bad body perspect:1.1)*

### Step 3: Combine the Image with the QR Code

- We can then send this to the img2img tab, or upload your image to the img2img tab if you already have one you want to use. We can enter the same positive and negative prompts.
- **IMPORTANT:** You have to enter prompts within the img2img tab for this to work

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/QR-codes-v2-1.jpg)

- **(1)** We can then select the sampling method as **DPM++ 2S** **a Karras**,
- **(2)** Sampling steps **60**
- **(3)** A resolution of **768 x 768**
- **(4)** A CFG Scale of **11**
- **(5)** And a Denoising strength as **1.0**

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/QR-codes-v2-2.jpg)

- We then need to go into ControlNet for it to do its magic! For **ControlNet Unit 0**, we need to upload the image again that was generated in the txt2img tab or your own image if you already have one.

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/QR-codes-v2-3.jpg)

- **(1)** Make sure to tick the checkbox to **Enable** ControlNet within ControlNet Unit 0
- **(2)** Select **OpenPose** as the Control Type, **openpose_full** as the pre-processor and **control_sd15_openpose** as the ControlNet model
- **(3)** We can leave the **Control Weight** at **1** as we are going to inform controlnet that our QR code should be weighted heavier
- **(4)** We can leave the the **Starting Control Step** at **0** and the **Ending Control Step** at **1** as we want our image to be generated from the initial start.
- **(5)** Select **Balanced** as the Control Mode  
- **(6)** And **Resize and Fill** for the Resize Mode.

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/QR-codes-v2-4B.jpg)

- We now need to go into the controlNet unit 1 tab (If you don't see this then you need to go into settings > controlNet and change the slider to show more than 1 controlNet tab

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/Multi_ControlNet.png)

- We can then upload our QR code to the controlNet Unit1 tab

![](https://learn.thinkdiffusion.com/content/images/2023/06/QR-codes-v2-5.jpg)

- **(1)** Ensure we click **enable** to make sure ControlNet is activated
- **(2)** Select **tile** as the Control Type,
- **(3) tile_resample** as the pre-processor  
- **(4) control_v11f1e_sd15_tile** as the controlNet model (You may have a different version of the controlNet tile model)
- **(5)** Set the control weight to **1.2** to inform control net that our QR code is slightly more important than our image!
- **(6)** Set the starting control step to **0.23** and the ending control step to **1**. This ensures that our image will start rendering before the QR code is rendered. It's more aesthetically pleasing on the eye this way!  
- **(7)** Set the control mode to **balanced**
- **(8)** and the resize mode to **Resize and fill**

### Step 4: High five!

Congrats, we can now click generate and we should have our QR code blended with our image!

Please note that you can play around with the control weight of both images to find a happy place! Also, you can tweak the starting control step of the QR image. I find these settings tend to give a decent look but also works as a QR code. They don't always scan though, just keep generating and tweaking to get the exact outcome you desire!

If you’re having issues with installation or slow hardware, you can try any of these workflows on a more powerful GPU in your browser with [ThinkDiffusion](https://www.thinkdiffusion.com/?ref=learn.thinkdiffusion.com).
